           ------------------------ BLURB ------------------------


Sharedance is a high-performance server that centralizes ephemeral key/data
pairs on remote hosts, without the overhead and the complexity of an SQL
database.

It was mainly designed to share caches and sessions between a pool of web
servers. Access to a sharedance server is trivial through a simple PHP API and
it is compatible with the expectations of PHP 4 and PHP 5 session handlers.


        ------------------------ COMPILATION ------------------------


libevent (http://libevent.org/) must be installed on your system, with
development files (headers).

Then, follow the boring traditional procedure:

./configure
make install-strip

For details, have a look at the INSTALL file.

The software has been successfully tested on Linux and OpenBSD.


            ------------------------ USAGE ------------------------


In order to store the data, Sharedance needs an empty directory to begin with.
By default, it will pick /tmp/sharedance, but you're strongly encouraged to
change this. If you're not planning to store huge data and if you need extreme
speed, use a memory filesystem like tmpfs (Linux/Solaris) or mfs (BSD).
As tons of files can be created in this directory, a modern filesystem like
ReiserFS or UFS+dirhash is strongly recommended.

The simplest way to start the daemon is something like:

/usr/local/sbin/sharedanced --directory=/var/tmp/sharedance --daemonize

The target directory has to exist before you run that command.
Two processes should run: "sharedanced [SERVER]" that accepts new connections
and stores/fetches/deletes the data, and "sharedanced [CLEANUP]" that purges
expired entries.

If something goes wrong, try to remove the --daemonize switch to get a
(hopefully) informative error message.

Sharedance listens to TCP port 1042 by default.

The php/sharedance.php file contains basic PHP functions to connect and use
the Sharedance server. Those functions can be included and reused in custom
applications. php/test_sharedance.php is such a sample application.

The php/session_handler.php file is what you should include before every
script in order to use Sharedance to store PHP sessions.

Copy the 'php' directory in a suitable location like /opt/sharedance/php .

Then edit the /opt/sharedance/php/session_handler.php file and change the
value of SESSION_HANDLER_HOST from 'localhost' to the name or IP address of
the server running sharedanced.

Next, edit your php.ini file and change:

auto_prepend_file=

to:

auto_prepend_file=/opt/sharedance/php/session_handler.php

Then, change:

session.save_handler = files

to:

session.save_handler = user

Alternatively you can just include session_handler.php on top of your scripts,
but don't do both (auto_prepend_file *or* require_once 'session_handler.php').

Restart Apache, do the same thing on every web server of the pool and sessions
are now automagically shared.


           ------------------------ OPTIONS ------------------------


Extra run-time options can be fed to sharedanced:

--ip=xxx          (-i) listen to this address (default=any)
--port=xxx        (-p) listen to that port (default=1042)
--backlog=xxx     (-b) change the backlog
--directory=xxx   (-d) directory where the data should be stored
--readsize=xxx    (-r) read buffer size
--maxreadsize=xxx (-R) max read size
--expiration=xxx  (-e) expiration of data in seconds
--timeout=xxx     (-t) disconnect after xxx seconds without data
--debug           (-D) verbose debug mode
--daemonize       (-B) operate in background
--uid=xxx         (-u) change user id
--gid=xxx         (-g) change group id

The backlog and the read buffer size probably don't need to be changed except
on extremely busy web sites.

By default, a key/data pair can be up to 32 Mb large. This is a huge default.
Start the server with that value and reduce it later according to the largest
files you get in the work directory.

Without the --expiration switch, a key/data pair expires after 30 minutes since last modification.
Fetching data does not extend the data lifetime.


    ------------------------ IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN ------------------------


- Sharedance was written in a non-blocking, non-forking fashion in order to
get an excellent scalability. Thanks to libevent, it can take advantage of
BSD's kqueue and Linux epoll_*() interfaces.

- data is sent through mapped memory.

- Sharedance has been written with security in mind. Care has been taken to
avoid buffer overflows, processes are chroot()ed to the working directory and
privileges are revoked after the listening socket has been
created.


        ------------------------ SYSTEM TUNING ------------------------


If you're planning to receive a lot of connections, you'll probably have to
tune your operating system accordingly before starting sharedanced.

Increase the number of descriptors. For instance on Linux:
/sbin/sysctl -w fs.file-max=65536
ulimit -n 65536

Increase the range for TCP outgoing ports. Linux:
/sbin/sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range="1024 65000"
